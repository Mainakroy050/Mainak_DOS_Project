# Mainak_DOS_Project

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of a multi-database approach in
managing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. By utilizing the ATTACK_DETECTION,
NETWORK_TRAFFIC, SYSTEM_RESOURCES, INCIDENT_RESPONSE, and
SECURITY_INFORMATION databases, we create a comprehensive framework for
monitoring and responding to security threats.
● ATTACK_DETECTION captures attack details and alerts.
● NETWORK_TRAFFIC monitors traffic patterns.
● SYSTEM_RESOURCES tracks system performance.
● INCIDENT_RESPONSE manages incident records and response plans.
● SECURITY_INFORMATION provides data on vulnerabilities and patches. Together,
these databases allow for detailed analysis and effective mitigation of DoS attacks,
improving overall network security. This integrated approach ensures a
well-rounded defense strategy and enhances our capability to address and prevent
security threats.
